I read intro how to make rpm, but it was long, boring, and even script 
from intro gave me some error (rpmbuild tool gave error "cannot cd cudatext-NNN",
I don't know what is this dir, I created only tar file).
So I give up.
You can make rpm. Files must be installed:

- cudatext -> to /usr/bin or any other dir from PATH
- dirs [data, readme, settings_default] -> to /usr/share/cudatext
- maybe also .desktop file(?)

Program reads dirs from /usr/share/cudatext on run, copies them to 
~/.cudatext if empty there.
