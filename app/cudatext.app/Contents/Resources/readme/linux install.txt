On Linux you can install program in such way:

- copy file "cudatext" to folder /usr/bin or any other
- copy dirs (data, readme, settings_default) to "~/.cudatext"

If program runs and cannot find "data/lexlib" near it, it opens dirs from
"~/.cudatext". This allows to install binary to PATH, and data dirs to homedir.

Can't do the same with the "deb" installer. (It runs as root and cannot write to homedir).
